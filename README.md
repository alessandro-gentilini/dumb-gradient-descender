A dumb gradient descender.

I was looking for minimizer with the following property: **simple to remember and so simple to code from scratch**.

I found interesting ideas in [*Lecture Notes: Some notes on gradient descent* by Marc Toussaint](https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mlr/marc/notes/gradientDescent.pdf), in [*Introduction to
Optimization, Gradient-based Methods* by the same author](https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mlr/marc/teaching/13-Optimization/02-gradientMethods.pdf) and in [*CS168: The Modern Algorithmic Toolbox Lecture #15: Gradient Descent Basics* by Tim Roughgarden & Gregory Valiant](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/l/l15.pdf).
